  <Mech_Scyther.description>Scythers are fast, spindly, armored human-sized combat Mechanoids. They usually carry one primary ranged weapon, and their bodies are adorned with two articulated blades to craft them deadly in melee combat. They don't use cover. They are best handled by concentrated, overwhelming force.</Mech_Scyther.description>

  <Mech_Mech_Crawler.description>Mech_Crawlers are small spider-like Mechanoids. While not particularly sturdy, their speed, size and numbers more than craft up for it. A 주석y plasma cutter at their front allows them to cut through metal like butter. Their favorite passtime is open surgery.</Mech_Mech_Crawler.description>
